# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest release is supported, with releases made approximately every year.

| Version     | Supported          |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| latest      | :white_check_mark: |
| archived    | :x:                |

This approach provides ample time for upgrading ensuring you are always on a supported release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you encounter a security vulnerability please take care to report in a responsible fashion:

1. Keep exploit details out of public mailing lists and issue tracker.

2. Report a security vulnerability via GitHub:

    Navigate to [security](https://github.com/gmt4/mpvc/security) page, use link for *Private vulnerability reporting*.

    For more information see [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

3. There is no expected response time. Be prepared to work with volunteers on a solution.

4. Keep in mind participants are volunteering their time, an extensive fix may require fundraising/resources.
